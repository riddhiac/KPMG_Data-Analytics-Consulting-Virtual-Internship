Task 1 : Data Quality Assessment

- Data Shape and Data Type
- Fix Missing — Null — NaN Values
- Handle Inconsistent Data

The data quality analysis is the core phase and due to errors in the data set, I suggest the following mitigates in order to improve the data quality, which will eventually help us to driven the better analytics, results for your company.
- We can take a mode year value for the missing records of customers DOB.
- We can assign a uniform last name of customers, which values are missing.
- Replace gender ‘U’ with reference to the customer name and make a consistency.
- For tenure values, we can take a mean of rest of the values and assign the mean value to the missing fields in order to maintain the consistency of data.
- Eliminate the blank orders considering fake orders.
